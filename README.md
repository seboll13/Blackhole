## Blackhole Physics animations
The goal of this small project is to test the physics of blackholes in a 2D environment.
The physics are for now simplified and are based on Newton's gravitational equations.
Ultimately, it would be nice to implement these physics based on [Einstein Field Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations) and the [Schwarzschild metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric).
All the code here is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library for the graphics.
